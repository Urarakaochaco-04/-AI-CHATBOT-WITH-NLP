### 📌 Project Overview

A simple chatbot that can answer random user questions using Wikipedia and saves the answers in a text file through a user-friendly GUI.

### 🧠 Concept of the Project

The idea is to create a basic AI-like chatbot that understands questions typed by the user and fetches relevant answers from Wikipedia. It’s designed to simulate a smart assistant that gives real-time answers on almost any topic — from history to science to famous personalities.


### 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this chatbot is to provide quick answers to user queries in an interactive way. It also lets users save those answers so they can refer to them later. This makes it useful for students, researchers, or anyone curious to learn.


### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**: Main programming language used for building the bot.
* **Tkinter**: Python’s standard GUI library to create the chatbot window.
* **Wikipedia Module**: A Python library that helps fetch information directly from Wikipedia.
* **Text File I/O**: Used to save the chatbot's answers in a `.txt` file.

### 🧪 How It Works (Methodology)

1. **User Interface (GUI)**:
   The chatbot uses a simple window built using Tkinter, where users can type in their questions.

2. **Getting the Answer**:
   When the user hits “Ask” or presses enter, the bot uses the `wikipedia` module to search and pull a summary related to the question.

3. **Displaying the Answer**:
   The bot shows the result in a chat-like format in the same window.

4. **Saving Answers**:
   If the user wants, they can click “Save” to store the answer in a text file named `chatbot_answers.txt`.

5. **Handling Errors**:
   If the question isn’t clear or Wikipedia can’t find an exact match, the bot replies politely that it couldn’t find an answer.

### 🔍 Outcome

The final chatbot is easy to use, looks simple, and gives decent answers to general questions. It’s a nice project to show how a Python script can be combined with GUI design and an online knowledge source like Wikipedia to make something useful.
